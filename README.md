# AutoIt Scripts

Various [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) scripts I used over the years to make my life easier as an IT worker.  
[View the official language documentation](https://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/)

## Usage
### Previous steps
Compile these files using **AutoIt**'s compiler to have the *.exe* files for easier execution.
### Example usage
Run the compiled script from the console:
```powershell

.\Convert-CSV-List.exe myFileWithList.csv

```
And get the desired output, either by file/console/clipboard, depending on the script.
  ### Further refinement
  You can drop your executable builds -with easier names- into *C:\Windows* (or any location within the *PATH* environment variable) and then executing them anywere.
  For example: I press the key "Windows", then write `upper` and convert any text in my clipboard to upper case.
  Note that the extension (i.e. ".exe") can be omitted when the file is executable.

## Requirements

**AutoIt** 3 or higher.
